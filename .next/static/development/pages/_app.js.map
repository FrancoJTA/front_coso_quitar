A standard or normal presentation of a mathematical entity [or\n//    object]. A canonical form is an element of a set of representatives\n//    of equivalence classes of forms such that there is a function or\n//    procedure which projects every element of each equivalence class\n//    onto that one element, the canonical form of that equivalence\n//    class. The canonical form is expected to be simpler than the rest of\n//    the forms in some way.\n//\n// That's a long-winded way of saying any two objects that have the same\n// canonical form may be considered equivalent, even if they are !==,\n// which usually means the objects are structurally equivalent (deeply\n// equal), but don't necessarily use the same memory.\n//\n// Like a literary or musical canon, this ObjectCanon class represents a\n// collection of unique canonical items (JavaScript objects), with the\n// important property that canon.admit(a) === canon.admit(b) if a and b\n// are deeply equal to each other. In terms of the definition above, the\n// canon.admit method is the \"function or procedure which projects every\"\n// object \"onto that one element, the canonical form.\"\n//\n// In the worst case, the canonicalization process may involve looking at\n// every property in the provided object tree, so it takes the same order\n// of time as deep equality checking. Fortunately, already-canonicalized\n// objects are returned immediately from canon.admit, so the presence of\n// canonical subtrees tends to speed up canonicalization.\n//\n// Since consumers of canonical objects can check for deep equality in\n// constant time, canonicalizing cache results can massively improve the\n// performance of application code that skips re-rendering unchanged\n// results, such as \"pure\" UI components in a framework like React.\n//\n// Of course, since canonical objects may be shared widely between\n// unrelated consumers, it's important to think of them as immutable, even\n// though they are not actually frozen with Object.freeze in production,\n// due to the extra performance overhead that comes with frozen objects.\n//\n// Custom scalar objects whose internal class name is neither Array nor\n// Object can be included safely in the admitted tree, but they will not\n// be replaced with a canonical version (to put it another way, they are\n// assumed to be canonical already).\n//\n// If we ignore custom objects, no detection of cycles or repeated object\n// references is currently required by the StoreReader class, since\n// GraphQL result objects are JSON-serializable trees (and thus contain\n// neither cycles nor repeated subtrees), so we can avoid the complexity\n// of keeping track of objects we've already seen during the recursion of\n// the admit method.\n//\n// In the future, we may consider adding additional cases to the switch\n// statement to handle other common object types, such as \"[object Date]\"\n// objects, as needed.\nvar ObjectCanon = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function ObjectCanon() {\n        // Set of all canonical objects this ObjectCanon has admitted, allowing\n        // canon.admit to return previously-canonicalized objects immediately.\n        this.known = new (canUseWeakSet ?

In previous versions, the equivalent option is named `onSubscriptionData`.\n *\n * Now, the first message will be added to the `accumulatedData` array since `onData` is called _before_ the component re-renders.
